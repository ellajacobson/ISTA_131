This dataset talks about murder report rates in each state of the U.S. I have chosen
this dataset because while it is a scary fact, it is something that is probably important
to know for your respective state. I have not yet decided how I want to interpret this
data and demonstrate in my project, whether that be visuals for the entire U.S., just for 
Arizona, just for Washington, or a comparison between Arizona and Washington. I choose 
these states because they are the two that I personally live in and travel between regularly.
